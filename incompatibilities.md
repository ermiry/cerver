# Incompatibilities

The changes of each version that can break code, binaries or peers built with the version before it, the newest first.
Unlike `CHANGELOG.md`, which only has the current version, every entry stays here.

## 2.0b-64 (from 2.0b-63)

The port of the core of the 1.8b-4 and the 1.8b-5, so the entries of `incompatibilities.md` in `core` for those betas
also apply here, and the changes of the core that `core` gets after it as the 1.8b-6. The ones that change the most:

- UDP cervers and clients (`udp.h`), with an auth token in every datagram, sessions and peers with references
- New fields (ABI): `Packet` (`release`, `release_args`), `Connection` (`shut_down`, `datagram_token`,
  `datagram_token_set`, `connect_timeout`), `Cerver` (`udp`, `udp_peer_timeout`, `udp_max_peers`, `udp_peers_count`,
  `handlers_alive_cond`), `Worker`; `Pool` and `JobQueue` changed completely
- `packet_delete ()` calls the `release` of the packet, a packet that is filled by hand must have it as NULL
- `MAX_UDP_PACKET_SIZE` is 65507, the default max received packet size of a cerver and of a client
- `Pool` is a stack on an array without a `dlist`, the last element pushed is the first one popped, and it can be
  limited with `pool_set_max_elements ()`; the pools of responses, multiparts and JWTs no longer allocate a node in
  each push
- `JobQueue` has priorities, timeouts and stats, without `queue`, `rwmutex` nor the `bsem` `has_jobs`; workers are
  joinable and wait for their states in a condition (`WORKER_SLEEP_TIME` was removed); `WorkerManager` is new
- A client tries each address that its host resolves to, with `connection_set_connect_timeout ()`, and resolves it
  again when it reconnects
- `network_parse_address ()` takes a zone in a link local address, and `sock_ip_to_string_actual ()` writes it, with a
  buffer of `NETWORK_ADDRESS_STRING_SIZE` bytes (it was `INET6_ADDRSTRLEN`)
- `HTTP_CLIENT_IP_SIZE` and `HTTP_REQUEST_CLIENT_IP_SIZE` are `NETWORK_ADDRESS_STRING_SIZE`, so the client ip of a
  request keeps the zone of a link local address, and a trusted proxy with a zone (`fe80::1%eth0`) is matched without
  its zone
- `sock_ip_equal ()` takes an IPv4 mapped address as equal to the IPv4
- The ready log of a cerver has its address, and `cerver_log_end ()` joins the thread that syncs the log file
- New field (ABI): `Socket` (`close_mutex`); the fd of a connection is closed with `socket_close ()`, replaced with
  `socket_replace ()` and shut down from other threads with `socket_shutdown ()`, all with that mutex, so a shutdown
  never reaches an fd that was closed and given to another connection; `socket_close ()` shuts the fd down and waits
  for a send of another thread (the write mutex) before it closes it, so it must not be called with the write mutex
- The check of the inactive clients shuts their sockets down after it releases the clients lock, with a reference to
  each socket
- `connection_connect ()` gives a connection without its mutex or its condition the ones that it has embedded, so its
  backoff can always be interrupted: the `sleep ()` of a connection without synchronization was removed
- A client connection whose connect failed, or that never connected, closes its socket: the failed connect closes it
  and `client_connection_end ()` closes it too (before, the fd stayed open after the teardown of the client)

## 2.0b-63 (from 2.0b-62)

The port of the core of the 1.8 (from 1.8b-1 to 1.8b-3), so the entries of `incompatibilities.md` in `core` for those
betas also apply here. The ones that change the most:

- `CERVER_TYPE_BALANCER` and the balancer (`balancer.h`) are part of the library, with the 1.x client features: async
  connect, connection states, send queue and reconnection
- New fields (ABI): `Cerver` (`bind_address`, `ipv6_only`, `balancer`, `connection_threads`, `event_threads`),
  `Client`, `Connection`, `Socket`, `CerverReceive`, `Handler` (`joinable`), `Thpool` (`stats`), `ThpoolJob`
  (`queued`), `ClientStats` and `ConnectionStats` (the storages of their packets per type)
- Connections, sockets, receives and clients are recycled: a pointer to one of them is never valid after it was
  deleted; their stats, mutexes and conds live inside them and must not be freed nor replaced
- Every send of the core uses `MSG_NOSIGNAL` and waits on a full non blocking socket up to the send timeout;
  `packet_send_split_tcp`, `packet_send_to_socket`, `file_send` and `file_send_by_fd` report the bytes that were really
  sent and fail when the data was not sent completely
- The HTTP responses are sent with `socket_send_vector ()`: `HTTP_RESPONSE_MILLISECONDS_PER_SECOND` and
  `HTTP_RESPONSE_NANOSECONDS_PER_MILLISECOND` were removed from `response.h`
- An IPv4 mapped address (`::ffff:a.b.c.d`) is written as `a.b.c.d`, and an IPv6 cerver always sets `IPV6_V6ONLY`
  (by default `false`); a client resolves its host with `getaddrinfo ()` and fails instead of connecting to
  `in6addr_any`
- The handlers threads are joinable and the teardowns join them, and they wait for the event and error actions that
  run in their own threads and for the detachable connection threads; a drain that times out waits
  `CERVER_DRAIN_GRACE_TIMEOUT` more seconds
- `client->session_id` is read with `client_get_session_id ()` from other threads
- A `FileHeader` whose filename is not a single NUL terminated name gets the "Missing or invalid file header" error
- The packets that no handler takes are released, and `client_connection_get_next_packet ()` accepts packets up to
  the client's max received packet size
- `cerver_deserialize ()` takes a `const SCerver *`
- `/cerver/metrics` has the thpool counters (`cerver_thpool_jobs_total`, `_jobs_completed_total`, `_rejected_total`,
  `_dropped_total`, `_waited_total`, `_queued_max`) and histograms (`cerver_thpool_wait_seconds`, `_run_seconds`)
- The workflows run in `container: gcc:16.2`, and `nightly.yml` is now `scheduled.yml`
