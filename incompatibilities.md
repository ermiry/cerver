# Incompatibilities

The changes of each version that can break code, binaries or peers built with the version before it, the newest first.
Unlike `CHANGELOG.md`, which only has the current version, every entry stays here.

## 2.0b-63 (from 2.0b-62)

The port of the core of the 1.8 (from 1.8b-1 to 1.8b-3), so the entries of `incompatibilities.md` in `core` for those
betas also apply here. The ones that change the most:

- `CERVER_TYPE_BALANCER` and the balancer (`balancer.h`) are part of the library, with the 1.x client features: async
  connect, connection states, send queue and reconnection
- New fields (ABI): `Cerver` (`bind_address`, `ipv6_only`, `balancer`, `connection_threads`, `event_threads`),
  `Client`, `Connection`, `Socket`, `CerverReceive`, `Handler` (`joinable`), `Thpool` (`stats`), `ThpoolJob`
  (`queued`), `ClientStats` and `ConnectionStats` (the storages of their packets per type)
- Connections, sockets, receives and clients are recycled: a pointer to one of them is never valid after it was
  deleted; their stats, mutexes and conds live inside them and must not be freed nor replaced
- Every send of the core uses `MSG_NOSIGNAL` and waits on a full non blocking socket up to the send timeout;
  `packet_send_split_tcp`, `packet_send_to_socket`, `file_send` and `file_send_by_fd` report the bytes that were really
  sent and fail when the data was not sent completely
- The HTTP responses are sent with `socket_send_vector ()`: `HTTP_RESPONSE_MILLISECONDS_PER_SECOND` and
  `HTTP_RESPONSE_NANOSECONDS_PER_MILLISECOND` were removed from `response.h`
- An IPv4 mapped address (`::ffff:a.b.c.d`) is written as `a.b.c.d`, and an IPv6 cerver always sets `IPV6_V6ONLY`
  (by default `false`); a client resolves its host with `getaddrinfo ()` and fails instead of connecting to
  `in6addr_any`
- The handlers threads are joinable and the teardowns join them, and they wait for the event and error actions that
  run in their own threads and for the detachable connection threads; a drain that times out waits
  `CERVER_DRAIN_GRACE_TIMEOUT` more seconds
- `client->session_id` is read with `client_get_session_id ()` from other threads
- A `FileHeader` whose filename is not a single NUL terminated name gets the "Missing or invalid file header" error
- The packets that no handler takes are released, and `client_connection_get_next_packet ()` accepts packets up to
  the client's max received packet size
- `cerver_deserialize ()` takes a `const SCerver *`
- `/cerver/metrics` has the thpool counters (`cerver_thpool_jobs_total`, `_jobs_completed_total`, `_rejected_total`,
  `_dropped_total`, `_waited_total`, `_queued_max`) and histograms (`cerver_thpool_wait_seconds`, `_run_seconds`)
- The workflows run in `container: gcc:16.2`, and `nightly.yml` is now `scheduled.yml`
